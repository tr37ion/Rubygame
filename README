A small Ruby coding experience.

# About
This is just a small text adventure project to teach myself Ruby.
I find it more compelling to learn programming by coding real
projects than just write 'Fibunaci' algorithms. Therefore, this is just
a first attempt to learn Ruby.

# Contribute
Sure, you can contribute code or even better you can write a great
story and also create some nice maps. Later on we could add many
other objects like: characters, items, things, quests and skills.

# Help
Basically, this is just code for my personal use. Yet, it would
be fun to find others who are new to Ruby programming. Also
experienced Ruby coders are welcome, too. They can help us in
writing better code and improve our skills faster on the go.

# General
I hope, this little project  be a good experience for all participants.
So, feel free to join in.
